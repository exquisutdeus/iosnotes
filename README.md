# iosnotes

Hello All!

This is my first repo and CSS theme attempt.

Would not have happened if it were not for Yurii Piskun, Sawhney, and the rest of the logseq custom themes community. 

Descrption: I wanted Logseq to look like Apple Notes on IOS, but function as Logeseq. This is the best that I could do!

include:
-minialist view
-ios similarities
  - colors: black, white, grey, orange
  - circle check box
  - small size fonts
  - tags
- QUERY: compact results
- Pages icons
- #kanban view
- Popups: Search
- eisenhower matrix by cannibalox
- vismode icon component by cannibalox

Computer works fine.

IOS Work in progress!

HELP:
- ios indent not workinhg after update
